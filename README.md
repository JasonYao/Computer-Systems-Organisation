# CSCI-UA-201: Computer Systems Organisation
By Jason Yao

## Description
An umbrella repository containing all C, ASM, and hexidecimal code 
used/ submitted for the "Computer Systems Organisation (CSCI-UA-201)" 
class.

Date: Spring, 2015

Location: New York University

Professor: Dr. Mohamed Zahran

Language(s): Assembly language (ASM), hexadecimal-encoding, C 
(On another note, if ever chatting with Dr.Zahran, ask him about his feelings on Java)

## What's in this repo
### Project 1: [Bufferbomb](Project1BufferBomb)
A programme to purposely simulate a malicious actor attempting to gain 
control of a system by an application of a buffer overflow attack upon 
a given executable file.

### Project 2: [Cache Optimisations](Project2CacheOptimisations)
A programme to show a deeper understanding of C optimisation in relation to the 
underlying hardware specifications. 

### Project 3: [Page Replacement Policies](Project3PageReplacementPolicies)
A programme to simulate several page replacement policies, and compare among 
them to identify the "best" page replacement policy in terms of performance.

## Course outcomes
- Learned foundations of C programming
- Learned about the underlying hardware implementations/limitations, including:
	- x86 Assembly, programmed using theory behind this
	- low-level debugging (val/cachegrind, gdb)
	- memory hierarchy
	- processes
	- virtual memory
